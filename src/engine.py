"""
README:
This script contains two object class definitions for playing the Mine Sweeper game.
The two classes are MineSweeper, which is the whole game, and Tile, which make up the board of the game.

# class for minesweeper game
class MineSweeper:
    """
    DESCRIPTION:
    The MineSweeper class contains the logic behind the Mine Sweeper game.

    PARAMETERS:
    - n_rows (int): the vertical size of the board
    - n_cols (int): the horizontal size of the board
    - n_mines (int): the amount of mines to be distributed on the board
    - safe_radius(int): the square radius around the first revealed tile where there will be no mines

    LIMITATIONS:
    - The randomly generated games can not always be solved without guessing.
    - Tiles that are flagged are not revealed when the reveal method recurses around empty tiles.

    METHODS:
    - self.valid_pos(row, col): checks if given row/column coordinates exist on the board
    - self.adjacent(row, col, radius): returns a set of adjacent tiles in a square radius
    - self.create_board(): creates a board of tiles in a list of lists
    - self.reveal(row, col): reveals a tile on the board, recurses when it reveals an empty tile
    - self.lay_mines(start_row, start_col): places mines on the board
    - self.assign_numbers(): counts the amount of adjacent mines for each tile
    - self.flag(row, col): places or removes flag on tile
    - self.game_over(): checks if the game has been won or lost and triggers corresponding eventhandlers
    - self.__iter__(): makes MineSweeper object iterable, looping over a MineSweeper object will go through each tile on the board
    - self.__next__(): calculates row/column indices and returns tile at those coordinates
    - self.__str__(): returns basic string representation of minesweeper board

    OUTPUTS:
    - the MineSweeper object
